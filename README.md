its a personal repo to set up some geoJson files and other related stuff, easiest way to host them. Found the files on Kaggle.

Here's the link:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pompelmo/usa-states-geojson

Any of the files uploaded here are for authors use only. In other words, its for a project that I'm doing.

If you find any of them useful, feel free to use them. However, if shit goes down, I probably would have less of a clue than you on how to fix it, so don't blame me.

I'm learning all of this (as I go along), same as you.
